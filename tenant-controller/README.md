micro-service orchestrates tenant creation and deletion within Edge Infrastructure Manager domain.

## Features

- Tenant creation and configuration bootstrapping
- Tenant deletion and cascade delets of tenant related resources in Inventory
- Vendor extension to bootstrap vendor specific configurations
- Built with the support for Multitenancy
- Flexible deployments that span from a standalone binary to container-based orchestrations

## Get Started

Instructions on how to install and set up the Tenant Controller on your development machine.

### Dependencies

Firstly, please verify that all dependencies have been installed.

```bash
# Return errors if any dependency is missing
make dependency-check
```

This code requires the following tools to be installed on your development machine:

- [Go\* programming language](https://go.dev) - check [$GOVERSION_REQ](../version.mk)
- [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) - check [$GOLINTVERSION_REQ](../version.mk)
- [go-junit-report](https://github.com/jstemmer/go-junit-report) - check [$GOJUNITREPORTVERSION_REQ](../version.mk)
- [Go mockgen](https://github.com/golang/mock) - check [$MOCKGENVERSION_REQ](../version.mk)
- Python\* programming language version 3.10 or later
- [protoc-gen-ent](https://github.com/ent/contrib/tree/master/entproto/cmd/protoc-gen-ent) - check
[$PROTOCGENENTVERSION_REQ](../version.mk)
- [Open Policy Agent\* (OPA) policy engine](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) - check [$OPAVERSION_REQ](../version.mk)
- [gocover-cobertura](github.com/boumenot/gocover-cobertura) - check [$GOCOBERTURAVERSION_REQ](../version.mk)

You can install Go dependencies by running `make go-dependency`.

### Build the Binary

Build the project as follows:

```bash
# Build go binary
make build
```

The binary is installed in the [$OUT_DIR](../common.mk) folder.

### Usage
